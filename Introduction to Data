# inner_join() function of dplyr needs to be given a "key" on which two data frames are joined. Actually, multiple keys that need to match 
# can be specified
# Join both data frames
ilo_data <- ilo_hourly_compensation %>%

# Count the resulting rows

# For displaying data in ggplot2 graphics, it is often helpful to convert all the variables to the right data type. Usually, 
# categorical variables like country in this example should be converted to factors before plotting them. You can do so using as.factor().
# In your data set, two columns are still of type "character" â€“ use mutate() to turn them into factors.

ilo_data_corrected <- ilo_data %>%
  mutate(year = as.factor(as.numeric(year)),
        country = as.factor(country))
