# The most common first step when conducting time series analysis is to display your time series dataset in a visually intuitive format. 
# The most useful way to view raw time series data in R is to use the print() command, which displays the Start, End, and Frequency of 
# your data along with the observations.
# Print the Nile dataset
print(Nile)

# List the number of observations in the Nile dataset
length(Nile)

# Display the first 10 elements of the Nile dataset
head(Nile,n=10)

# Display the last 12 elements of the Nile dataset
tail(Nile,n=12)
