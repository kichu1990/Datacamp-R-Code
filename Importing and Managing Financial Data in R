# The getSymbols() function from the quantmod package provides a consistent interface to import data from various sources into your 
# workspace. By default, getSymbols() imports the data as a xts object.

# Load the quantmod package
library(quantmod)

# Import QQQ data from Yahoo! Finance
getSymbols("QQQ")

# Look at the structure of the object getSymbols created
str(QQQ)

# Look at the first few rows of QQQ
head(QQQ)

# getSymbols() imports data from Yahoo! Finance by default because src = "yahoo" by default

# Import QQQ data from Alpha Vantage
getSymbols("QQQ",src="av")

# Look at the structure of QQQ
str(QQQ)

# Import GDP data from FRED
getSymbols("GDP",src="FRED")

# Look at the structure of GDP
str(GDP)

# getSymbols() automatically created an object named like the symbol you provided.

# Assign SPY data to 'spy' using auto.assign argument
spy <- getSymbols("SPY",auto.assign = FALSE)

# Look at the structure of the 'spy' object
str(spy)

# Assign JNJ data to 'jnj' using env argument
jnj <- getSymbols("JNJ",env = NULL)

# Look at the structure of the 'jnj' object
str(jnj)

# Turning off auto.assign is useful if you want to assign the data to an object yourself.
