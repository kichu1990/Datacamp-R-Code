# The getSymbols() function from the quantmod package provides a consistent interface to import data from various sources into your 
# workspace. By default, getSymbols() imports the data as a xts object.

# Load the quantmod package

# Import QQQ data from Yahoo! Finance

# Look at the structure of the object getSymbols created
str(QQQ)

# Look at the first few rows of QQQ

# getSymbols() imports data from Yahoo! Finance by default because src = "yahoo" by default

# Import QQQ data from Alpha Vantage
getSymbols("QQQ",src="av")

# Look at the structure of QQQ

# Import GDP data from FRED
getSymbols("GDP",src="FRED")

# Look at the structure of GDP

# getSymbols() automatically created an object named like the symbol you provided.

# Assign SPY data to 'spy' using auto.assign argument

# Turning off auto.assign is useful if you want to assign the data to an object yourself.
# getSymbols() uses the Symbols and src arguments to specify the instrument and data source, respectively. The Quandl() function 
# specifies both the data source and the instrument via its code argument, in the form "DATABASE/DATASET".
# Quandl() returns a data.frame by default.
# Quandl() will not automatically assign the data to an object.

# The quantmod package provides several helper functions to extract specific columns from an object, based on the column name. 
# The Op(), Hi(), Lo(), Cl(), Vo(), and Ad() functions can be used to extract the open, high, low, close, volume, and adjusted close 
# column, respectively.

# Extract the close column
dc_close <- Cl(DC)

# Look at the head of dc_close
head(dc_close)

# Extract the volume column
dc_volume <- Vo(DC)

# Extract the high, low, and close columns

# Extract the open, high, low, close, and volume columns
dc_ohlcv <- OHLCV(DC)

# Look at the head of dc_ohlcv

# The getPrice() function in the quantmod package can extract any column by name by using the prefer argument. It can also extract 
# columns for a specific instrument by using the symbol argument, which is useful when an object contains several instruments with the 
# same price type.
# Download CME data for CL and BZ as an xts object

# Sometimes you need to aggregate and/or transform raw data before you can continue your analysis. The Quandl() function allows you to
# specify common aggregations and transformations via the collapse and/or transform arguments.

# Changing the default source for one instrument is useful if multiple sources use the same symbol for different instruments.

# But getSymbols("CP", src = "FRED") would load Corporate Profits After Tax from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.
# setSymbolLookup() to specify the default data source for an instrument.To make getSymbols("CP") load the corporate profit data from

# At some point, you might download data for an instrument that does not have a syntactically valid name. Syntactically valid names 
# contain letters, numbers, ".", and "_", and must start with a letter or a "." followed by a non-number.
# For example, the symbol for Berkshire Hathaway class A shares is "BRK-A", which is not a syntactically valid name because it contains
# a "-" character. Another example are Chinese stocks, which have symbols composed of numbers. The Yahoo Finance symbol for the SSE 
# Composite Index is "000001.SS".
# You can use the get function or backticks (`) to access objects that do not have syntactically valid names.
# Load BRK-A data

# Sometimes two series have the same periodicy, but use different conventions to represent a timestamp. For example, monthly series
