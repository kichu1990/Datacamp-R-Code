# The getSymbols() function from the quantmod package provides a consistent interface to import data from various sources into your 
# workspace. By default, getSymbols() imports the data as a xts object.

# Load the quantmod package
library(quantmod)

# Import QQQ data from Yahoo! Finance
getSymbols("QQQ")

# Look at the structure of the object getSymbols created
str(QQQ)

# Look at the first few rows of QQQ
head(QQQ)

# getSymbols() imports data from Yahoo! Finance by default because src = "yahoo" by default

# Import QQQ data from Alpha Vantage
getSymbols("QQQ",src="av")

# Look at the structure of QQQ
str(QQQ)

# Import GDP data from FRED
getSymbols("GDP",src="FRED")

# Look at the structure of GDP
str(GDP)

# getSymbols() automatically created an object named like the symbol you provided.

# Assign SPY data to 'spy' using auto.assign argument
spy <- getSymbols("SPY",auto.assign = FALSE)

# Look at the structure of the 'spy' object
str(spy)

# Assign JNJ data to 'jnj' using env argument
jnj <- getSymbols("JNJ",env = NULL)

# Look at the structure of the 'jnj' object
str(jnj)

# Turning off auto.assign is useful if you want to assign the data to an object yourself.
# getSymbols() uses the Symbols and src arguments to specify the instrument and data source, respectively. The Quandl() function 
# specifies both the data source and the instrument via its code argument, in the form "DATABASE/DATASET".
# Quandl() returns a data.frame by default.
# Quandl() will not automatically assign the data to an object.
# Load the Quandl package
library(Quandl)

# Import GDP data from FRED
gdp <- Quandl("FRED/GDP")

# Look at the structure of the object returned by Quandl
str(gdp)

# The Quandl() function returns a data.frame by default. It can return other classes via the type argument.
# Import GDP data from FRED as xts
gdp_xts <- Quandl("FRED/GDP",type="xts")

# Look at the structure of gdp_xts
str(gdp_xts)

# Import GDP data from FRED as zoo
gdp_zoo <- Quandl("FRED/GDP",type="zoo")

# Look at the structure of gdp_zoo
str(gdp_zoo)

# You need the instrument identifier to import data from an internet data source. They can often be found on the data source website.
# Create an object containing the Pfizer ticker symbol
symbol <- "PFE"

# Use getSymbols to import the data
getSymbols(symbol)

# Look at the first few rows of data
head(PFE)

# Create a currency_pair object
currency_pair <- "GBP/CAD"

# Load British Pound to Canadian Dollar exchange rate data
getSymbols(currency_pair, src = "oanda")

# Examine object using str()
str(GBPCAD)

# Try to load data from 190 days ago
getSymbols(currency_pair, from = Sys.Date() - 190, to = Sys.Date(), src = "oanda")

# Create a series_name object
series_name <- "UNRATE"

# Load the data using getSymbols
getSymbols(series_name, src = "FRED")

# Create a quandl_code object
quandl_code <- "FRED/UNRATE"

# Load the data using Quandl
unemploy_rate <- Quandl(quandl_code)
