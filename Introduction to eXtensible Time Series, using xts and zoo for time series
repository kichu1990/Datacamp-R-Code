# Load xts
library(xts)

# xts objects are simple. Think of them as a matrix of observations combined with an index of corresponding dates and times.
# xts = matrix + times
# The main xts constructor takes a number of arguments, but the two most important are x for the data and order.by for the index. 
# x must be a vector or matrix. order.by is a vector which must be the same length or number of rows as x, be a proper time or date 
# object (very important!), and be in increasing order.

# View the structure of ex_matrix

# Extract the 3rd observation of the 2nd column of ex_matrix

# Extract the 3rd observation of the 2nd column of core 
core[3,2]

# Create the object data using 5 random numbers

# Create dates as a Date class object starting from 2016-01-01
dates <- seq(as.Date("2016-01-01"), length = 5, by = "days")

# Use xts() to create smith
smith <- xts(x = data, order.by = dates)

# Create bday (1899-05-08) using a POSIXct date class object
bday <- as.POSIXct("1899-05-08")

# Create hayek and add a new attribute called born

# Convert austres to an xts object called au

# Then convert your xts object (au) into a matrix am

# Inspect the head of am2

# Create dat by reading tmp_file

xts_dat <- xts(dat, order.by = as.POSIXct(rownames(dat)))

# Convert dat into xts
xts(dat, order.by = as.Date(rownames(dat), "%m/%d/%Y"))

# Read tmp_file using read.zoo
dat_zoo <- read.zoo(tmp_file, index.column = 0, sep = ",", format = "%m/%d/%Y")

# Convert dat_zoo to xts

# Convert sunspots to xts using as.xts().
sunspots_xts <- as.xts(sunspots)

# Get the temporary file name
tmp <- tempfile()

# Write the xts object using zoo to tmp 
write.zoo(sunspots_xts, sep = ",", file = tmp)

# Read the tmp file. FUN = as.yearmon converts strings such as Jan 1749 into a proper time class
sun <- read.zoo(tmp, sep = ",", FUN = as.yearmon)

# Convert sun into xts. Save this as sun_xts
sun_xts <- as.xts(sun)

# The ISO-8601 standard is the internationally recognized and accepted way to represent dates and times. The standard allows for a common
# format to not only describe dates, but also to represent ranges and repeating intervals.
# xts makes use of this standard for all extract and replace operations. This makes code both easy to write and easy to maintain. 
# It also makes for very concise expression of date ranges and intervals.

# One of the most powerful aspects of working with time series in xts is the ability to quickly and efficiently specify dates and time 
# ranges for subsetting.Date ranges can be extracted from xts objects by simply specifying the period(s) you want using special character
# strings in your subset.

# Select all of 2016 from x
x_2016 <- x["2016"]

# Select January 1, 2016 to March 22, 2016
jan_march <- x["2016/2016-03-22"]

# Verify that jan_march contains 82 rows
82 == length(jan_march)

# Extract all data between 8AM and 10AM

# Extract the observations for January 13th, 2010

# Subset x using the vector dates
x[dates]

# Subset x using dates as POSIXct

# Replace the values in x contained in the dates vector with NA
x[dates] <- NA

# Replace all values in x for dates starting June 9, 2016 with 0
x["2016-06-09/"] <- 0

# Verify that the value in x for June 11, 2016 is now indeed 0
x["2016-06-11"]

# Create lastweek using the last 1 week of temps
lastweek <- last(temps, "1 week")

# Print the last 2 observations in lastweek
last(lastweek, 2)

# Extract all but the first two days of lastweek
first(lastweek, "-2 days")

# Extract the first three days of the second week of temps
first(last(first(temps, "2 weeks"), "1 week"), "3 days")

# xts objects respect time. By design when you perform any binary operation using two xts objects, these objects are first aligned
# using the intersection of the indexes. This may be surprising when first encountered.
# The reason for this is that you want to preserve the point-in-time aspect of your data, assuring that you don't introduce accidental 
# look ahead (or look behind!) bias into your calculations.
