# Load xts
library(xts)

# xts objects are simple. Think of them as a matrix of observations combined with an index of corresponding dates and times.
# xts = matrix + times
# The main xts constructor takes a number of arguments, but the two most important are x for the data and order.by for the index. 
# x must be a vector or matrix. order.by is a vector which must be the same length or number of rows as x, be a proper time or date 
# object (very important!), and be in increasing order.

# Inspect the head of am2

# Create dat by reading tmp_file

# Convert dat into xts

# Convert sunspots to xts using as.xts().
sunspots_xts <- as.xts(sunspots)

# Get the temporary file name
tmp <- tempfile()

# Write the xts object using zoo to tmp 
write.zoo(sunspots_xts, sep = ",", file = tmp)

# Read the tmp file. FUN = as.yearmon converts strings such as Jan 1749 into a proper time class
sun <- read.zoo(tmp, sep = ",", FUN = as.yearmon)

# Convert sun into xts. Save this as sun_xts
sun_xts <- as.xts(sun)

# The ISO-8601 standard is the internationally recognized and accepted way to represent dates and times. The standard allows for a common
# format to not only describe dates, but also to represent ranges and repeating intervals.
# xts makes use of this standard for all extract and replace operations. This makes code both easy to write and easy to maintain. 
# It also makes for very concise expression of date ranges and intervals.

# One of the most powerful aspects of working with time series in xts is the ability to quickly and efficiently specify dates and time 
# ranges for subsetting.Date ranges can be extracted from xts objects by simply specifying the period(s) you want using special character
# strings in your subset.

# Select all of 2016 from x
x_2016 <- x["2016"]

# Select January 1, 2016 to March 22, 2016
jan_march <- x["2016/2016-03-22"]

# Verify that jan_march contains 82 rows
82 == length(jan_march)

# Extract all data between 8AM and 10AM

# Subset x using dates as POSIXct

# Replace the values in x contained in the dates vector with NA
x[dates] <- NA

# Replace all values in x for dates starting June 9, 2016 with 0
x["2016-06-09/"] <- 0

# Verify that the value in x for June 11, 2016 is now indeed 0
x["2016-06-11"]

# Create lastweek using the last 1 week of temps
lastweek <- last(temps, "1 week")

# Print the last 2 observations in lastweek
last(lastweek, 2)

# Extract the first three days of the second week of temps
first(last(first(temps, "2 weeks"), "1 week"), "3 days")

# xts objects respect time. By design when you perform any binary operation using two xts objects, these objects are first aligned
# using the intersection of the indexes. This may be surprising when first encountered.
# The reason for this is that you want to preserve the point-in-time aspect of your data, assuring that you don't introduce accidental 
# look ahead (or look behind!) bias into your calculations.

# xts makes it easy to join data by column and row using a few different functions. All results will be correctly ordered in time, 
# regardless of original frequencies or date class. One of the most important functions to accomplish this is merge(). It takes one or 
# more series and joins them by column. It's also possible to combine a series with a vector of dates. This is especially useful for 
#normalizing observations to a fixed calendar.
# merge() takes three key arguments which we will emphasize here. First is the ..., which lets you pass in an arbitrary number of 
# objects to combine. The second argument is join, which specifies how to join the series - accepting arguments such as inner or left.
# This is similar to a relational database join, only here, the index is what we join on. The final argument for this exercise is fill.
# This keyword specifies what to do with the new values in a series if there is missingness introduced as a result of the merge.

diff(AirPass, lag = 12, differences = 1)

One of the benefits to working with time series objects is how easy it is to apply functions by time.

# The main function in xts to facilitate this is endpoints(). It takes a time series (or a vector of times) and returns the locations of 
# the last observations in each interval.

# The argument on supports a variety of periods, including "years", "quarters", "months", as well as intraday intervals such as "hours",
# and "minutes". What is returned is a vector starting with 0 and ending with the extent (last row) of your data.
# In addition to each period, you can find the Kth period by utilizing the k argument. For example, setting the arguments of your 
# endpoints() call to on = "weeks", k = 2, would generate the final day of every other week in your data. Note that the last value 
# returned will always be the length of your input data, even if it doesn't correspond to a skipped interval.

# Locate the weeks
endpoints(temps, on = "weeks")

# Locate every two weeks
endpoints(temps, on = "weeks", k = 2)

# Calculate the weekly endpoints
ep <- endpoints(temps, on = "weeks")

# Now calculate the weekly mean and display the results
period.apply(temps[, "Temp.Mean"], INDEX = ep, FUN = mean)

# The split() function creates a list containing an element for each split. The f argument in split() is a character string describing
# the period to split by (i.e. "months", "years", etc.).

# Split temps by week
temps_weekly <- split(temps, f = "weeks")

# Create a list of weekly means, temps_avg, and print this list
temps_avg <- lapply(X = temps_weekly, FUN = mean)

# Use the proper combination of split, lapply and rbind
# Use the split()-lapply()-rbind() paradigm, given for you in the script, to find the last 
# observation in each week in temps. It is stored in temps_1.
temps_1 <- do.call(rbind, lapply(split(temps, "weeks"), function(w) last(w, n = "1 day")))

# Create last_day_of_weeks using endpoints()
last_day_of_weeks <- endpoints(temps,on = "weeks")

# Subset temps using last_day_of_weeks 
temps_2 <- temps[last_day_of_weeks]

# Convert usd_eur to weekly and assign to usd_eur_weekly
usd_eur_weekly <- to.period(usd_eur, period = "weeks")

# Convert usd_eur to monthly and assign to usd_eur_monthly
usd_eur_monthly <- to.period(usd_eur, period = "months")

# Convert usd_eur to yearly univariate and assign to usd_eur_yearly

# Convert eq_mkt to quarterly using shortcut function
mkt_quarterly2 <- to.quarterly(eq_mkt, name = "edhec_equity", indexAt = "firstof")

# Calculate basic rolling value of series by month
# One common aggregation you may want to apply involves doing a calculation within the context of a period, but returning the interim 
# results for each observation of the period.
# For example, you may want to calculate a running month-to-date cumulative sum of a series. This would be relevant when looking at 
# monthly performance of a mutual fund you are interested in investing in.

# Split edhec into years
edhec_years <- split(edhec, f = "years")

# Use lapply to calculate the cumsum for each year in edhec_years
edhec_ytd <- lapply(edhec_years, FUN = cumsum)

# Use do.call to rbind the results
edhec_xts <- do.call(rbind, edhec_ytd)

# Use rollapply to calculate the rolling 3 period sd of eq_mkt
eq_sd <- rollapply(eq_mkt, 3, sd)

# View the first three indexes of temps

# Construct times_xts with tzone set to America/Chicago

# The idea of periodicity is pretty simple: With what regularity does your data repeat? For stock market data, you might have hourly 
# prices or maybe daily open-high-low-close bars. For macroeconomic series, it might be monthly or weekly survey numbers.

# Count the months
nmonths(edhec)

# Count the quarters

# xts uses a very special attribute called index to provide time support to your objects. For performance and design reasons, the index
# is stored in a special way. This means that regardless of the class of your index (e.g. Date or yearmon) everything internally looks 
# the same to xts. The raw index is actually a simple vector of fractional seconds since the UNIX epoch.
# Normally you want to access the times you stored. index() does this magically for you by using your indexClass. To get to the raw 
# vector of the index, you can use .index(). Note the critical dot before the function name.
# More useful than extracting raw seconds is the ability to extract time components similar to the POSIXlt class, which closely mirrors 
# the underlying POSIX internal compiled structure tm. This functionality is provided by a handful of commands such as .indexday(), 
# .indexmon(), .indexyear(), and more.

# Explore underlying units of temps in two commands: .index() and .indexwday()
.index(temps)
